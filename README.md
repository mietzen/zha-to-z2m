**This worked for me and hopefully will work for you, but MAKE BACKUPS!\

If you don't understand any of the code below, DON'T run this!\

Also don't do this when you are in a hurry â€” this might completely destroy your Home Assistant ZHA setup.\
You have been warned... watch out for dragons...**

# Migrate ZHA to Z2M

This script will migrate your [ZHA](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/) device to [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) using `core.device_registry` and `zigbee.db` from Home Assistant and will generate/edit `devices.yaml`, `configuration.yaml`, and `database.db` in `/homeassistant/zigbee2mqtt`.

It will also install [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq).

Thanks to [seidtgeist](https://github.com/seidtgeist), [toine512](https://github.com/toine512) and [teal-bauer](https://github.com/teal-bauer), whose work this is based on.

Tested on arm64 (amd64 prepared but untested) on Home Assistant Operating System.

On other Home Assistant setups this will only work **with** modifications!

## Before Migrating

For this to work, you need to:
 - Install Zigbee2MQTT
 - Install Mosquitto
 - Stop ZHA
 - Start Zigbee2MQTT
 - Stop Zigbee2MQTT

Afterward, connect to home assistant via `ssh` and run the commands below:

## Start Migration

```shell
set -euo pipefail

cd /homeassistant

# Install yq
wget "https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest/download/yq_linux_$(arch | sed -e 's/x86_64/amd64/' -e 's/aarch64/arm64/')" -O /usr/bin/yq; chmod +x /usr/bin/yq

# On my instalation the tables got postfix versions string like _v11 _v12 _v13, we need to get the latest version:
VERSION=$(sqlite3 zigbee.db "SELECT COALESCE('_v' || MAX(CAST(substr(name, instr(name, '_v') + 2) AS INT)), '') FROM sqlite_master WHERE name LIKE '%_v%' AND type='table';")

# Append the Database:
sqlite3 zigbee.db "SELECT CONCAT('{"'"'"id"'"'": ', (ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY d.ieee)) + 1, ', "'"'"type"'"'": "'"'"EndDevice"'"'", "'"'"ieeeAddr"'"'": "'"'"0x', REPLACE(d.ieee, ':', ''), '"'"'", "'"'"nwkAddr"'"'": ', d.nwk, '}') FROM devices${VERSION} d JOIN endpoints${VERSION} e ON d.ieee = e.ieee ;" >> /homeassistant/zigbee2mqtt/database.db

# Get the ZHA Zigbee config:
ZIGBEE_CONF=$(sqlite3 zigbee.db "SELECT backup_json FROM network_backups${VERSION} ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1 ;" | jq -c)

# Parse and transform:
pan_id=$(echo "$ZIGBEE_CONF" | jq -r '.network_info.pan_id' | awk '{print "0x" $1}')
ext_pan_id=$(echo "$ZIGBEE_CONF" | jq -r '.network_info.extended_pan_id' | awk -F: '{for (i=8; i>0; i--) printf "0x%s%s", $i, (i>1?", ":"")}')
channel=$(echo "$ZIGBEE_CONF" | jq -r '.network_info.channel')
network_key=$(echo "$ZIGBEE_CONF" | jq -r '.network_info.network_key.key' | awk -F: '{for (i=1; i<=NF; i++) printf "0x%s%s", $i, (i<NF?", ":"")}')

# Delete the advanced key from the default configuration
yq -i 'del(.advanced)' /homeassistant/zigbee2mqtt/configuration.yaml

# Append the parsed data:
cat <<EOF >> /homeassistant/zigbee2mqtt/configuration.yaml
advanced:
  pan_id: $pan_id
  ext_pan_id: [$ext_pan_id]
  channel: $channel
  network_key: [$network_key]
devices: devices.yaml
EOF

# Create the friendly device names:
jq -c '.data.devices[]' /homeassistant/.storage/core.device_registry | while read -r dev; do
    id=$(echo "$dev" | jq -r '.identifiers[0] // empty')
    [[ -z "$id" || "$(echo "$id" | jq -r '.[0]')" != "zha" ]] && continue
    
    mac=$(echo "$id" | jq -r '.[1]' | tr -d ':')
    name=$(echo "$dev" | jq -r '.name_by_user // .name' | sed "s/'/''/g")
    
    echo "'0x$mac':" >> devices.yaml
    echo "    friendly_name: '$name'" >> /homeassistant/zigbee2mqtt/devices.yaml
done
```

## Post Migrating

Start Zigbee2MQTT, your devices should be migrated, but you need to interview them again:

> Since zigbee2mqtt has no information about devices yet, they all are in unsupported state.
> I then requested interview for each device. All details are retrieved from the device and it starts operating in Z2M.
> 
> The usual wisdom applies: first interview mains-powered devices that you know are routers, then all mains powered devices, then battery-powered ones. You will have to go and wake up each battery-powered device.

If everything worked, delete ZHA. If you want, you can also delete `yq` with `rm /usr/bin/yq`.
